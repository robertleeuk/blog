Recently, I've been consistently and diligently rating movies on Watcha Pedia. Here are the reasons why:

1. It's fun to record my taste in movies. When I'm too lazy to write but want to leave my thoughts, it's perfect.
2. There's a sense of satisfaction in training the recommendation algorithm. It's enjoyable to see Watcha Pedia's recommendations become more accurate.
3. It's interesting to find out why my ratings differ from others' ratings.
4. I don't have to pretend to be a film critic. Looking back at my comments later is amusing.

In conclusion, it feels like I'm structuring my taste, and I really enjoy it.
